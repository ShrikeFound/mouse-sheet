# Gwendolyn | Mouseguard Character Tracking App

A web application to make playing and running the Mouseguard RPG a bit easier. You can create a mouse following the basic character creation steps outlined in the rules, then use the character sheet to track your inventory, skill progress, wises, etc.

You can make your character public so that others can see it, or create a group and share your character with only those in the group.
